# ESP_As_Repeater
We would use ESP as both station and access point and route the local network from esp to the internet
till now: 


Connect to an Existing WiFi Network: Modify the code to connect to an existing WiFi network as a client. This will allow your device to connect to the existing network and use its internet connection.    "done" ....



Act as an Access Point: Keep the access point functionality so that other devices can connect to your device as if it were a WiFi hotspot.   "done"....



Routing Traffic: You'll need to route the traffic between the connected client devices and the existing WiFi network.   "undergoing goal......"
